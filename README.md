# What to expect from this workshop?
When it comes to learning new software, the process can be tricky and sometimes even intimidating, especially if you are already accustomed to another similar software. Whether you already have GIS experience or maybe you are a new user, the purpose of this workshop is to introduce you to QGIS, a professional GIS application that is built on top of and proud to be itself Free and Open Source Software.
At the end of this workshop, you should have a good understanding of what QGIS consists of and be able to view, edit, analyze, create and manage GIS data inside QGIS.
